# STATE — THiNX Device API

**Last updated:** 2026-06-02 (v1.9 roadmap created — 7 phases, 13 requirements mapped)

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-06-02)

- **Core value:** The IoT device API stays available and trustworthy across release cycles — every public route the legacy AngularJS console relied on (which Vue inherited) keeps working with no signature breaks. Operational pipeline (push → CI → Swarmpit autoredeploy) stays under a 5-minute SLA.
- **Current focus:** Phase 5 — Backend Hygiene — Cheap Sweeps
- **Latest production image:** `thinxcloud/api:latest sha256:4d3fb789` (v1.0 Phase 4 deploy 2026-05-26T22:35:54Z); v1.9 base bumped to `1.9.3054` 2026-06-02 via `304b09d1`
- **Sibling project:** `services/console/.planning/` — Vue console GSD workspace (v1.0 frontend shipped; SEC-DEP-02 console-side dep triage scheduled for Phase 10)

## Current Position

Phase: 5 (Backend Hygiene — Cheap Sweeps) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 4
Status: Executing Phase 5
Last activity: 2026-06-02 -- Phase 5 execution started

## Milestones

- ✅ **v1.0 — v1 GA Backend Closures** (shipped 2026-05-27) — see `.planning/MILESTONES.md`
- 🚧 **v1.9 — Backend Hygiene & Posture** (in planning) — Phases 5–11; see `.planning/ROADMAP.md`

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions (current — full v1.0 decision log in `.planning/MILESTONES.md` + PROJECT.md Key Decisions)

- 2026-06-02 — v1.9 milestone started with 13 requirements across 7 phases (Phases 5–11). Phase numbering continues from v1.0's last phase (Phase 4) — orchestrator did NOT pass `--reset-phase-numbers`.
- 2026-06-02 — Phase clustering: low-risk REFACTOR sweeps (Phase 5) → WS-surface (Phase 6) → owner.js async/await (Phase 7) → auth lifecycle (Phase 8, sequenced after 7) → independent: managed_logs PII (Phase 9), services/console SEC-DEP-02 coordination (Phase 10), base/update.sh + ca.pem probe (Phase 11).
- 2026-06-02 — Phase 5 scope amendment: REFACTOR-05 reduced to `jshint`-only reclassification (moved to `devDependencies`); `fs-finder` STAYS in `dependencies` because the internally-owned fork (`github:suculent/Node-FsFinder#master`) has 5 active runtime call sites in `lib/`. Full `fs-finder` removal sweep deferred to a proposed v1.10 phase. Amendment recorded in ROADMAP.md (Phase 5 success criterion 3 + Notes) and REQUIREMENTS.md (REFACTOR-05 sub-bullet); rationale in `.planning/phases/05-backend-hygiene-cheap-sweeps/05-CONTEXT.md` REFACTOR-05 decision block.
- 2026-05-27 — v1.0 shipped; project transitioned from "v1 GA gap closures" narrow scope to long-lived backend lifecycle.
- 2026-05-27 — Operator decision Option B (v1.0 Phase 4 Slice 4): services/console merge-up deferred; tracked via SEC-DEP-02 (now scheduled as Phase 10 of v1.9).
- 2026-05-27 — Verification artifact gap (v1.0 Phases 1-3 lack structured `*-VERIFICATION.md`) accepted as process-debt.

### Todos

- Run `/gsd:plan-phase 5` to start v1.9 Phase 5 (Backend Hygiene — Cheap Sweeps: REFACTOR-01, REFACTOR-02, REFACTOR-05).

### v1.10 Candidates

- **fs-finder removal sweep** (v1.10 candidate, deferred from v1.9 Phase 5 REFACTOR-05): replace `finder.from()` / `finder.in()` / `finder.findFiles()` calls in 5 modules (`lib/thinx/builder.js`, `lib/thinx/deployment.js`, `lib/thinx/platform.js`, `lib/thinx/repository.js`, `lib/thinx/plugins/arduino/plugin.js`) with `fs-extra` glob helpers (already a dep) OR native `fs.promises.readdir` recursion. After the sweep lands, `fs-finder` can be removed from `package.json` entirely. Estimated touch surface: ~10 call sites across ~5 files. Sequenced after v1.9 ships.

## Cross-Project Touchpoints

- **`services/console/.planning/`** — Vue console GSD workspace (sibling project); Phase 10 of v1.9 schedules + rolls up the parallel SEC-DEP-02 phase there. Phase 8 (AUTH-RESET-LINK-CONSOLE) coordinates with the console's password-set route.
- **`AGENTS.md`** (parent root) — ssh details, deploy flow, dependency locks (chai-http v4 hold). Consult before any phase touches deploy config or `package.json`. TEST-CHAI-01 stays deferred from v1.9 per the lock.
- **`.planning/runbooks/swarm.md`** — canonical swarm autoredeploy recovery runbook (v1.0 Phase 3). Phase 9 of v1.9 will extend the runbooks set with a GDPR-posture note for the historic managed_logs cleanup; Phase 6 may extend with a WS handshake runbook.

## Session Continuity

**Stopped at:** Phase 5 context gathered

**Next action:** Run `/gsd:plan-phase 5` to start Phase 5 (Backend Hygiene — Cheap Sweeps: REFACTOR-01, REFACTOR-02, REFACTOR-05).
